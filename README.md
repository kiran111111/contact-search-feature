# React + TypeScript + Vite


1. The Contact Search feature allows you to filter the contacts based upon search filters.

2. Run " npm install " to install all the dependencies

3. Run " npm run dev " to run the local dev server

4. I have used vite in this project due to its build performance and faster development speed.
