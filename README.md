# Contact Search Feature (React + TypeScript + Vite)

* Node version used : v20.18.0
* NPM version used : v10.8.2

1. The Contact Search feature allows you to filter the contacts based upon search filters.

2. Run " npm install " to install all the dependencies

3. Run " npm run dev " to run the local dev server

4. Developed the project using vite due to its build performance and faster development speed.

5. The test json data includes 10 rows in the contacts.json file. For showing the functionality of pagination - I have shown 3 rows per page.
